            <p>I am Yufni, and I am from Chile. I like many things, like piano, movies, and food! I was born October 23rd, 2002 in a city called "La Serena." I went to school and started playing the piano win my mid-teenage years, which would eventually lead me to winning the 3rd place of a 2018 national piano competition. When I turned 16, my mother and I moved to the US to live with my oldest sister and her family in Texas. After living 2 years in that state, my family decided to move to Arizona, where almost instantly I got to meet my now wife. After playing the cat and mouse game with her, we both went on our own separate LDS missions for the years 2022 and 2023. I was part of the California, Los Angeles Mission where I was able to teach and preach the Gospel to the latino population of the city. This was an amazing time. Day after day I would see miracles as my companions and I prayed to find people to teach and serve. Studying the scriptures and deeping my knowledge and understanding of Jesus Christ's Atonement was also a highlight of my time in LA. After finishing my mission, I was able to come back home and finally marry the love of my life, who is now pregnant with our first child.</p>
